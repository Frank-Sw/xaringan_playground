I made my very first Xaringan presentation two weeks ago. Of course I didn't take my time to learn it slowly and without pressure. No - I decided to swap to  Xaringan just before a talk at satRdays Amsterdam. I had a lot of code chunks and normal ioslides only showed a fraction of the code without giving me a lot of flexibility, and copy pasting snippets wasn't really what I wanted to do.

So Xaringan it was.  
There is a lot of information about Xaringan: wiki's, blog posts (see resources below). Many of these resources are brilliant,and I would advice to browse through them as well. However most people will likely be like me: you don't start on Xaringan when you have no slides to make, you start when you are busy with them and having to browse through many resources that often have beginners-and advanced things through each other is not so easy. I had 8 tabs open with examples and every time i wanted to do something  

These blog posts want to build on that material. This contain the version of what I would have wanted to see: the essentials first, some easy tricks
So this is the version I would have wanted to see: the essentials first, some easy tricks, less experimentation needed because

I assume that you know the basics of markdown. If not, you might want to experiment with traditional Rmarkdown first... Or continue here: ....

# Getting started

### Installing xaringan


Go to New > R Markdown > from Template > Ninja presentation {xaringan}


At the very top in the YAML header, change the title, author date, but leave everything else for now (we'll get to YAML options later).
Below the YAML is a large presentation on Xaringan made by Yihui. It contains a ton of information on everything you do. And I would advice to look through it at some point, but if this is your first xaringan my advice would be to delete everything below the first code chunk. Because a lot of info has the power to confuse as well...





### Making your first slides

The basic rules of slide-making:
- Different slides are separated by three dashes.
- The text content of the slides follows traditional markdown formatting with #, ##, ### indicating different header levels.



```
# Title slide 1

Content slide 1  
More content slide 1


---

# Title slide 2

Content slide 2  
More content slide 2

```


You can make the usual markdown bullet lists.
And you make incremental slides (i.e. slide content appearing block by block rather than in one go) by adding two dashes `--` where you want to 'click'. 
In the below example, each item of a bullet list will appear one by one.


```
---

# Title

+ Content I want to see first

--

+ Content I want to see added after clicking

-- 

+ Content I want to see added after clicking a second time

---

```



### Adding images

Adding images makes the presentation a lot less dry, and there are a few ways to add images.


#### Option 1: using background images

One of the easiest ways is to use `background-image`:  
At the very top of your slide (before any class indications)

The advantage of using `background-image` is that's very flexible: you can make your image full slide or small, and you have a lot of flexibility on the position of your image as well. 

By default, your image is put in the center of the slide and maintains the original size.


```
---

background-image: url(images/network.jpg)

# Title

Slide content

---

```

For a 'real' background image, the intent is usually to fill the full slide. You can set the `background-dize: cover` to achieve this. Any titles or text you add will be written on top. You might want to change the alignment of the text to have it sit left center. How to do this will be explained below.


```
---

background-image: url(images/bulb.jpg)
background-size: cover


# Background-image


---

```




For other images, size and position can be modified until you have what you want: 
+ To adapt the size: you can add a `background-size` argument
+ To adjust the position you add first the horizontal position, then the vertical position.

```
---

background-image: url(images/network_medium.png)
background-size: 100px
background-position: 0% 0%


# Background-image

Slide content

---
```

> Add examples on different positions


If you want more than one image in the background-image way, you can add multiple images via a comma:

```
---

background-image: url(images/network_medium.png), url(images/cloud.png)
background-size: 100px, 100px
background-position: 10% 90%, 30% 90%

# Two background images

Slide content

---

```


#### Option 2: using markdown images

Using background images gives you a lot of flexibility on size and position, but sometimes you need trial and error to get the position right. If you want your images in a certain spot versus text, this can be annoying - especially if you start changing the slide a bit more.

One other way to add images is using traditional markdown. It will show images inline with your text, but the downside is that you have no control over size, so these images already need to be scaled correctly before adding.

>> insert code and picture


You have some control over position of the images, but not much. You can use the content classes to put an images left, center or right.

>> insert code and picture


#### Option 3: using HTML images

If you want inline, but you also want control over the size of the pictures, you also have the option to leverage html pictures inside your slides:
