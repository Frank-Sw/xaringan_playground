# Getting rid of the default coverpage

The default cover page takes 

- To change the background colour, font colour, font type etc --> CSS
- If you want an image, you can set that up in css, but I found it faster to just do this:

Add seal: false to your YAML header and set the very first slide as a picture. This will make the default disappear.



# Changing from standard to widescreen slides

Adding inside nature: ratio 16/9 will change the slide ratio :)
