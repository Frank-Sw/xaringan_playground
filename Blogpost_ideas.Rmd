# Getting rid of the default coverpage

The default cover page takes 

- To change the background colour, font colour, font type etc --> CSS
- If you want an image, you can set that up in css, but I found it faster to just do this:

Add seal: false to your YAML header and set the very first slide as a picture. This will make the default disappear.



# Changing from standard to widescreen slides

Adding inside nature: ratio 16/9 will change the slide ratio :)



# Images

The most versatile option is to use background-image, but this will only allow one image on a slide.
Standard is center and middle of the screen, if you want to adjust you can use background-position followed by the horizontal and then the vertical position on screen in %. Changing the size: background-size: cover or px.

A second option is to use markdown-flavoured images. This will allow you to have multiple images on slide, but is a bit more limited in position and sizing.

html images

html <img> tags work as well, and this way you can have multiple images on a slide and adapt their size more flexibly than in markdown.



# alignment

Use the class property upfront to change the alingment of a complete slide.

If you only want to change a block of text, you can use content classes.


# naming a slide

naming a slide can be useful when you want to link back to a specific slide. Automatically they get numbered but as we all know: numbers can change, a name usually doesnt.



# Highlight: 
For non-r code bocks, star will highlight



# click through your slidedecks!
