Here's a second slide. Standard it's 4/3 ratio, but most projectors are widescreen these days...

# Adding markdown style images

There is another way though:  
This will add an image inline: ![](images/database_small.png)

--

Or you can add them using the content classes:  
.left[![](images/database_small.png)]

--

And even add multiple more: 
.center[![](images/database_small.png) ![](images/cloud_small.png) ![](images/graph_small.png)]

# Adding images HTML style

I will add a picture here:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suzanbaert/xaringan_playground/master/images/database.png" width="100">

And perhaps one more here:

class: center

# Slide alignment

By changing the css class to center at the start of the slide,  
the entire text  
will be 
centered.

---

# Text block alignment

If you only want a block of text to be changed you have to use a content class and square brackets.

.center[Like this  
for example.]

.bottom.right[Or here I am   
completely on the right!]


---

name: part2

# Part 2

Giving a slide a name can be easy within the HTML afterwards: you can refer to it without user numbers (which tend to change while you're working on a presentation)


---

# Highlight lines

For non r clode blocks, putting a * in front of the line will highlight that line
* bit can i highloight somethin ghere?

```{r}
a <- 1
{{b <- 2 }}

```
